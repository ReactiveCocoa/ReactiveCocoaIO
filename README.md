# ReactiveCocoaIO

ReactiveCocoaIO is a framework for accessing and manipulating a file system
through signals, based on
[ReactiveCocoa](https://github.com/github/ReactiveCocoa).

## Usage

- Add ReactiveCocoaIO.xcodeproj and
External/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoaFramework/ReactiveCocoa.xcodeproj (or your
own ReactiveCocoa project file) to your project or workspace.
- Add both frameworks (or libraries) to your target's link phase.
